    "- Your analysis here:\n",
    "In general from all 15 schools of the district summary, there are a little more than 39,000 students in total. From all students, 75% passed math and 86% passed reading, but only 65% passed both exams. Therefore, the overall passing in all 15 schools is below 70% by 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "8 schools are charter and the other 7 are part of the district. The 3 biggest school that range from 4,500-5,000 students are part of the district; meanwhile, 3 smallest schools are charter that range from 400-1500 students. In addition the district has a lower passing rate than the charter. All 15 schools have about the same budgetting that range from $580-670. From this, it can be concluded that spending of school in each student doesn’t affect the passing, but instead, the school size does affect if students pass or don’t because charter have an overall passing rate of 90.50% while District has an overall passing rate of 53.86%.\n",
